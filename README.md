# Signature method for brain-computer interfaces

The implementation of two signature-based methods applied on electroencephalography(EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). The first method uses the path signature directly as a feature vector. The second method takes negative square of the lead matrix constructed from the second level signature and adds a regularization term to get a symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix to be used as features. 

A simple example of classification of left/right motor imagery of one subject in [Physionet MI dataset](https://physionet.org/content/eegmmidb/1.0.0/) is given. However these methods are general and can be applied to other paradigms of EEG-based BCIs.
